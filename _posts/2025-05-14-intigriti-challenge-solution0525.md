I thoroughly enjoyed tackling this month‚Äôs [CTF challenge](https://challenge-0525.intigriti.io/) hosted by [@Intigriti](https://x.com/intigriti) and skillfully crafted by [@joaxcar](https://bsky.app/profile/joaxcar.bsky.social). It took me about six hours to solve from start to finish.

Let‚Äôs dive right in ‚Äî 
## üîç Here‚Äôs the code we needed to exploit with an XSS:


```js
// utils
function safeURL(url){
 let normalizedURL = new URL(url, location)
 return normalizedURL.origin === location.origin
}

function addDynamicScript() {
    const src = window.CONFIG_SRC?.dataset["url"] || location.origin + "/confetti.js"
    if(safeURL(src)){
        const script = document.createElement('script');
        script.src = new URL(src);
        document.head.appendChild(script);
    }
}

// main
(function(){
    const params = new URLSearchParams(window.location.search);
    const name = params.get('name');

    if (name && name.match(/([a-zA-Z0-9]+|\s)+$/)) {
        const messageDiv = document.getElementById('message');
        const spinner = document.createElement('div');
        spinner.classList.add('spinner');
        messageDiv.appendChild(spinner);

        fetch(`/message?name=${encodeURIComponent(name)}`)
        .then(response => response.text())
        .then(data => {
            spinner.remove();
            messageDiv.innerHTML = DOMPurify.sanitize(data);
        })
        .catch(err => {
            spinner.remove();
            messageDiv.innerHTML = "Error fetching message.";
            console.error('Error fetching message:', err);
        });
        
    } else if(name) {
        const messageDiv = document.getElementById('message');
        messageDiv.innerHTML = "Error when parsing name";
    }

    // Load some non-misison-critical content
    requestIdleCallback(addDynamicScript);
})();
```
## üëÄ Initial Observations
Initially, it seemed quite challenging and secure‚Äîwith origin validation and the OG DOMPurify, bypassing it looked nearly impossible. However, as I examined the code line by line, the very first thing that caught my attention was this:


```js
const src = window.CONFIG_SRC?.dataset["url"] || location.origin + "/confetti.js"
```

This part seemed suspicious, and I quickly understood that DOM clobbering would be needed to define `CONFIG_SRC`. At first, I tried injecting HTML elements, but the regex filter blocked those attempts. However, on closer inspection, I realized the regex was bypassable‚Äîit lacked a `^` anchor, so it didn‚Äôt enforce checks from the input‚Äôs start. For example, a string like `</strong> Some text` would pass because the regex only validates from where it begins to ‚Äúmake sense.‚Äù After bypassing the regex, I was eager to inject elements into the DOM. To clobber `CONFIG_SRC`, I inserted a `div` with an `id` of `CONFIG_SRC` and a custom data attribute, like this:


```html
<div id='CONFIG_SRC' data-url='https://example.com'>
```

## ‚è±Ô∏è The requestIdleCallback and Origin validation Problem

`data-url` was used because the JS was trying to get the URL from the dataset attribute named `url`. I injected the above payload and was pretty confident it would work, but it didn't. While debugging, I found that `window.CONFIG_SRC` was still undefined even though the element existed in the DOM. **I was like, what the heck?** If it‚Äôs in the DOM, why isn‚Äôt it working? After a while, I noticed that `addDynamicScript` was used as a callback to this strange function `requestIdleCallback`. I tried researching it, but there isn‚Äôt much info online. From the MDN docs, I understood that it calls a function only when the event loop is idle‚Äîbasically to run non-essential tasks without blocking the main thread during busy rendering or other important operations. I realized it runs when the fetch request is sent and waiting for a response. Since fetch is asynchronous and doesn‚Äôt block the main thread, the thread remains mostly free while fetch waits, so `addDynamicScript` executes before the fetch completes.

After hours of frustration, I concluded I had to delay the execution of `addDynamicScript` by keeping the main thread busy for a while. I tried messing with the regex to trigger a ReDoS attack, but that didn‚Äôt work at the time (more on this later). I also considered speeding up the fetch call instead. This is where caching helped: I injected a cache header via Burp, retried the attack, and it worked because the fetch response came almost instantly. The tricky part was figuring out how to get it cached. After struggling, I realized it was a rabbit hole and decided to use Burp‚Äôs custom header injection to let the cache work and move on to the next step‚Äîbypassing the origin check done in `safeURL`.


```js
function safeURL(url){
 let normalizedURL = new URL(url, location)
 return normalizedURL.origin === location.origin
}

function addDynamicScript() {
    const src = window.CONFIG_SRC?.dataset["url"] || location.origin + "/confetti.js"
    if(safeURL(src)){
        const script = document.createElement('script');
        script.src = new URL(src);
        document.head.appendChild(script);
    }
}
```

I had an inkling that this could be bypassed due to differences in how the `URL` constructor was implemented in the two functions‚ÄîI was sure there had to be some inconsistency. I quickly opened devtools and started debugging the variable values. After about an hour of debugging and fuzzing, I managed to bypass it with this payload:


```
https:/example.com/
```

Notice that only one `/` is used after `https:`, which tricks the `URL` constructor into treating it as a relative URL and appending it to `window.location`. When it compares the origins of both URLs, they appear the same. But if the URL is passed without an origin, the constructor is forced to parse and correct the `/` issue. Voil√†! This bypasses the origin check, allowing a JS file hosted on any domain to serve as our XSS payload and trigger an alert. However, it wasn‚Äôt that simple‚ÄîI still had to bypass the `requestIdleCallback` mechanism.

At this point, I looked for hints posted by Intigriti, but none made sense to me at the time. The only takeaway was that I needed to manipulate some form of window isolation or something along those lines.

```
You are keeping your windows isolated right?
```

I wasn‚Äôt quite sure what the hints were pointing to at first. Then I noticed the page didn‚Äôt have any headers or protections against framing. I figured framing might help, so I tried framing it and loaded some render-heavy elements to keep the event loop busy. After some attempts, I managed to trigger an alert in Chrome. But from the Discord server, I knew the real nightmare was getting it to work on Firefox. Sure enough, it didn‚Äôt work there.

        var container = document.querySelector(".container");
        container.innerHTML = ele;
        // This will force the browser to render the SVG
        // and block the main thread
        for (var i = 0; i < 1200; i++) {
          container.innerHTML += ele;
        }
      }
      setTimeout(run, 2);
    </script>

```

## üß© The Final Puzzle ‚Äî Firefox
Side note: when I do CTFs or hack, I follow a general approach ‚Äî first get the idea, then implement it; if it fails, dig into the root cause, fix it if possible, or move on. So I tested the idea in Firefox, it failed, and I got curious why. After digging deeper, I concluded Firefox runs the challenge frame in a separate thread because the parent and child are cross-origin. It‚Äôs not that simple, but for brevity, let‚Äôs assume it‚Äôs due to the cross-origin nature of the parent page and child frame \([more here](https://hassansin.github.io/shared-event-loop-among-same-origin-windows)\).

This left me stumped. I tried finding gadgets on the challenge page to bridge the gap, but there were none, and from the cross-origin parent page, I had no way to influence that other thread.

I reached out to Johan and he told me what I was looking for was in the hints. For some reason, my brain immediately flashed back to an error I‚Äôd seen earlier while messing with the regex. The error was:

```
Uncaught InternalError: too much recursion
```
This happened because the `name` parameter was too long for the regex to process, causing the thread to stay busy. I realized this was the solution and quickly started implementing it. After several attempts, I managed to trigger the XSS by framing multiple ReDoS payloads along with one frame containing the actual XSS payload.
